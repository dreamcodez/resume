I was in charge of scaling the server architecture on _weedmaps.com_ from 10K to 100K unique pageviews per day. I was also in charge of rewriting key parts of the site (homepage, region page, dispensary page, and search system) in a new nodejs codebase to replace the old Joomla equivalents.

#####Senior System Administrator, Bolthouse Farms (_bolthouse.com_)
######February 2009 to December 2010 - Bakersfield, California
Implemented many software solutions including an HA VMware cluster, Business Objects BI, an HA SQL Server Cluster, several intrusion detection systems, and some internal applications. I was one of 3 responsible for overseeing 200 servers both physical and virtual at the company datacenter. I also assisted the marketing team from a near seo-disaster when they launched a flash-only website and almost lost several years of hard earned link-juice (their old html content pages). We converted the graphical concept to an html-friendly concept and incorporated old good content.
