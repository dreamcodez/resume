##### Principal Platform Architect, Stem Disintermedia, Inc.
###### October 2015 to July 2017 - Hollywood, California
Stem helps music collaborators receive royalties in a fair way. I architected the system and wrote much of the prototypal code; we used react/relay/graphql/postgres/rabbitmq as our stack. I also envisioned and wrote some of the prototype code for the open sourced join-monster: "A Query Planning and Batch Data Fetching between GraphQL and SQL".
